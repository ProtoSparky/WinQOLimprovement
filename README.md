# WinQOLimprovement
small qol improvements made using windows batch file. Use it if you want!

This is best used if you set this up so it runs RunSilent.bat as admin torugh task scheduler. 

you can also uncomment some code, so that it would make periodic backups of the registry before it runs. It's commented, because depenting on the pc running it'll take a couple minutes to run. Uncomment it if you dont care seeing a windows terminal for a couple minutes backing up data. Leave it commented if you want speed
Do note i will be updating this when i want other settings to be applied on run
